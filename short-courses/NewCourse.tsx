The programme addresses one of the biggest challenges faced by governments, development institutions, NGOs, and the private sector: translating strong climate ideas and policies into bankable, fundable project proposals. The course integrates global climate finance architecture with hands-on proposal development aligned to major funding sources such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF), Global Environment Facility (GEF), Adaptation Fund, development banks, bilateral donors, and private investors. Participants will gain practical experience in climate project design, theory of change, logical frameworks, budgeting, safeguards, and results-based reporting. By the end of the programme, participants will be able to develop high-quality concept notes and full funding proposals that meet donor requirements and national climate priorities.",

The course provides a holistic understanding of CSA pillars, technological innovations, climate-resilient value chains, sustainable land management, and policy frameworks shaping agricultural transformation in Africa. Participants will gain hands-on experience in CSA planning, climate risk assessment, field-level adaptation techniques, agronomic best practices, digital agriculture tools, and the integration of CSA into national and regional agricultural programmes. Through case studies, demonstrations, and practical exercises, the programme prepares practitioners to design and implement CSA interventions at farm, community, institutional, and national levels.",

The programme responds to increasing pressure on real estate owners and managers to enhance asset performance, improve capital efficiency, manage risk, and integrate sustainability and technology into real estate decision-making. The course integrates strategic asset management, real estate finance, portfolio optimisation, governance, and performance management, aligned with international best practices in corporate and investment real estate management. Participants will gain hands-on experience in real estate strategy formulation, asset optimisation, capital planning, and performance measurement—enabling them to manage real estate as a strategic business asset rather than a passive holding.",
